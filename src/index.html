      Dear participant, <br />
      Thank you very much for participating in my study. The purpose of this study is to compare different cursor types to see which of them help users select on-screen targets faster and more accurately. 
      <br /><br /><b>What you need</b>
      <ul>
        <li>A pointing device. A mouse is recommended.</li>
        <li>A screen (laptop screen or desktop monitor) of at least Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080). A smaller screen size may greatly impact the result of this study.</li>
        <li>Google Chrome. This study has not been tested on other web browsers.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Procedure</b>
      <ul>
        <li>This study should take 15 minutes or less of your time.</li>
        <li>Your task, in brief, is to <b><u>click on the only green circle</u></b> among many circles on the screen. When you have successfully clicked on the target, the circles will be re-located for the next trial.</li>
        <li>After every 9 trials, you have 5 seconds to prepare for the next block of trials. A countdown will be displayed before the next group of circles appear on the screen.</li>
        <li>After 27 blocks, your cursor type will be changed. There are two types of cursor: pointer and bubble. The pointer cursor works as a normal cursor, which requires you to hover on a target in order to click the target. The bubble cursor, however, allows you to click on the target as soon as the target is in range.</li>
        <li>The study ends when you have finished all 54 blocks. Once you see a message which confirms the completion, you can safely close your web browser.</li>
        <li>You can click the Start button below to begin the experiment.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">WARNING: Please do not close the browser tab or resize the Chrome window during the study. Doing this may cause problem to the application; your progress will be lost after that and you will have to start the experiment from the beginning again.</span>
